I sure have been on this ride a long time. I enjoy life because I have too. It is the only thing that I can easily control.
I stopped trying to control peoples' thoughts and action a long time ago. I wouldn't say that I don't care how people feel about me,
but it certainly doesn't bear much impact on my decision making process. At best, I may just keep my mouth shut to avoid having to 
argue.
