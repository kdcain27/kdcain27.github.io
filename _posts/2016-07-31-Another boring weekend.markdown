I got into the bees Friday and one of my nucs was decimated by wax moths. My first thought is always to blame myself but, honestly, there are six other hives within 10 feet of this one and not one of them even showed signs of wax moths.  The only thing that I do take blame for is that the infestation had gotten so out of hand that I threw the entire nuc onto the burn pile in that corner of the yard.  On a side note... I finally did get to put a new radiator and water pump in my 4runner. It was a messy job, but it went fairly well and overall, I am satisfied. Maybe next weekend will be more productive and exciting.
